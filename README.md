# Random-Contract-for-GoldFish
The code for a random contract is designed for game users to upgrade their goldfish using tokens. The upgrade process is completed by executing the contract once, with a 50% chance of a successful upgrade and a 50% chance of a downgrade. This result will be transparent on the blockchain.
